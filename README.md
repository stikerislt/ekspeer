# ekspeer
This repository contains an article documenting the design and implementation of ekspeer, an expense-focused subscription tracking app built to make recurring costs visible, predictable, and easy to control.

The project started from a simple problem: subscriptions silently drain budgets because expenses are fragmented, hard to audit, and rarely reviewed. Instead of treating subscriptions as a list, ekspeer treats them as ongoing financial obligations that should integrate directly into expense tracking and budgeting.

This write-up covers:

Why expense tracking should be the foundation of subscription management

How recurring charges affect monthly and annual cash flow

Design decisions for tracking, categorizing, and reviewing expenses

Practical lessons from building a real budgeting tool for daily use

The content is intended for developers, indie founders, and anyone interested in building or using tools that prioritize financial clarity over feature overload.
